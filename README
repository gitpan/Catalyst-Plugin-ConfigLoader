NAME
    Catalyst::Plugin::ConfigLoader - Load config files of various types

SYNOPSIS
        package MyApp;
    
        # ConfigLoader should be first in your list so
        # other plugins can get the config information
        use Catalyst qw( ConfigLoader ... );
        
        # by default myapp.* will be loaded
        # you can specify a file if you'd like
        __PACKAGE__->config( file = > 'config.yaml' );    

DESCRIPTION
    This mdoule will attempt to load find and load a configuration file of
    various types. Currently it supports YAML, JSON, XML, INI and Perl
    formats.

METHODS
  setup( )
    This method is automatically called by Catalyst's setup routine. It will
    attempt to use each plugin and, once a file has been successfully
    loaded, set the "config()" section.

  finalize_config
    This method is called after the config file is loaded. It can be used to
    implement tuning of config values that can only be done at runtime. If
    you need to do this to properly configure any plugins, it's important to
    load ConfigLoader before them. ConfigLoader provides a default
    finalize_config method which walks through the loaded config hash and
    replaces any strings beginning with "__HOME__/<path>" with the full path
    to the file inside the app's home directory.
