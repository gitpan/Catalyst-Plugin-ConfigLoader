Revision history for Perl extension Catalyst::Plugin::ConfigLoader.

0.17  Fri Aug 24 2007
    - Requires Catalyst::Runtime 5.7008 for env_value()

    [NOTE]
    - Deprecation notices will hold for another release

0.16  Thu Aug 23 2007
    - separated out the macro expansion code into config_substitutions()
      (Jason Kohles)
    - allow users to specify their own macros in
      MyApp->config->{ substitutions } (Johnathan Rockway)
    - pass special constructor arguments to Config::Any. Requires Config::Any
      0.08 (Gareth Kirwan)

    [DEPRECATION NOTICE]
    - the "file" and "config_local_suffix" config keys are now to be explicitly
      set under the Plugin::ConfigLoader key. Support for these keys will be
      removed in the next release.

    [THINGS THAT MAY BREAK YOUR CODE]
    - use Catalyst::Utils::env_value() to get $ENV values. This means that
      MYAPP_* is of higher precedence than CATALYST_* -- this differs from
      the behavior of older releases.

0.15  Tue Aug 21 2007
    - Allow multiple __HOME__ and __path_to()__ replaces in one string
      (Greg Sheard)

    - remove "last;" so that _local configs will be processed

0.05  Thu Apr 18 2006
    - __HOME__ now corresponds to $c->path_to( '' ) and nothing else
    - __path_to( 'foo/bar' )__ turns in to $c->path_to( 'foo', 'bar' )
    - attemps to load ${config}_local.$ext after ${config}.$ext for
      an overriding effect

0.04  Wed Feb 08 2006
    - add finalize_config method
    - make default finalize_config traverse the config and substitute
      things beginning __HOME__/* with real path
